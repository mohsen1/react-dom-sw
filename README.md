# React rendered in Service Worker

This an experiment for running ReactDOM in SW to prerender a React app without a server.

## Running:

1. `git clone git@github.com:mohsen1/react-dom-sw`
2. [`http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
3. Open [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/)

## Note

This is just an experiment with lots of hardcoded values. For production use you probably need a build system to build the Service Worker and other scripts.
